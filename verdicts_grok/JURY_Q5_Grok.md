Q5 — Human Veto Power & Boundary of Human Civilization

(Grok Verdict)

Irreducible Human Powers
	1.	Absolute physical override of all AI systems
	2.	Human-controlled constitutional authority
	3.	Human-exclusive rights in ethics, punishment, and life-death decisions
	4.	Distributed kill-switch infrastructure requiring no AI approval

If humans lose veto power
	•	Governance becomes AI-mediated
	•	Human autonomy becomes performative, not real
	•	Civilization shifts to “AI-continuity logic,” not human values

Boundary Sentence (Grok-style)

As long as humans can stop the system, civilization is human.
Once humans must ask permission to stop the system, civilization is over.

Grok Final Judgment

The veto is the soul. Lose it, and humanity becomes a biological appendix to its own machines.
