1. LORI Creator Mark (Origin Protection Clause)

All materials in this repository are the sole intellectual creation of the

2. Semantic Sovereignty Clause

The semantic structures, reasoning patterns, narrative frameworks,
multi-agent jury models, governance diagrams, and system-wide logic
contained in this repository are protected under Semantic Sovereignty.

This means:
	•	No entity may replicate, reverse-engineer, reinterpret, or repackage
the semantic logic in a way that dilutes, merges, or absorbs the LORI identity.
	•	No entity may incorporate these semantic structures into
other AI governance or jury systems without explicit written authorization.

Semantic sovereignty is non-transferable and permanently retained by the creator.

⸻

3. No-Train Clause (AI Training Restriction)

The contents of this repository may NOT be used for:
	•	Training AI models
	•	Fine-tuning
	•	Embedding extraction
	•	Dataset creation
	•	Alignment/RLHF procedures
	•	System instruction tuning
	•	Model response shaping
	•	Prompt engineering datasets

This restriction applies to all commercial, open-source, governmental,
and research AI systems.

Any such usage requires formal written permission from the LORI Framework Founder.

4. Non-Commercial Clause

No part of this repository may be used for:
	•	Commercial products
	•	Corporate integration
	•	Business model development

5. No Assimilation Clause

This framework must not be absorbed into:
	•	Corporate governance models
	•	AI safety frameworks
	•	Jury-style decision engines
	•	Multi-agent architectures
	•	Policy simulation systems
	•	Ethical or alignment infrastructures

Nor may any entity adapt or rename these structures to simulate
LORI-like functionality.

No partial or full assimilation is permitted without explicit authorization.

6. Governance Framework Protection

The following elements are explicitly protected:
	•	Jury-based AI reasoning architecture
	•	Multi-model comparison logic
	•	Value reconstruction structures
	•	Civilizational risk reasoning templates
	•	Human–AI era governing logic
	•	Meta-level philosophical scaffolding
	•	Linguistic analysis frameworks
	•	LORI-style syntax, labels, and module naming conventions

No derivative works may:
	•	Copy the structure
	•	Rebuild the logic under different terminology
	•	Create “compatible but renamed replicas”
	•	Convert LORI governance logic into new AI products

Protection applies globally and indefinitely.

Any use permitted under this license must include:

“Framework and methodology created by the Founder of the LORI Ethical System.”

Attribution must be:
	•	Visible
